# Content complaints

## Problem

As groups count and size grows, and as we are moving to working large groups, so will the abuse, so we need report function for active groups that would forward the message that members may find offensive or inappropriate or off-topic or violating any rules that community wants to have.

It doesn't mean that the moderators must censor everything that is reported, and even less so, it should be centralized (although in our directory our directory bot would also receive these complaints).

## Solution

A new protocol message that is sent via the existing connection in the group only to group moderators, admins and owners.

These messages will appear in the special folder "Reports" in admin/owner profiles, with the information about the message itself and who sent it and in which group, with the ability to navigate to that message, delete or mark as deleted.

To send, the members would choose Report from the context menu (that would complement Moderate function available to group admins) and then choose the reason: e.g., Illegal, Inappropriate, Off-topic.
